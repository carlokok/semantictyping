# Semantic typing

Example of semantic typing in RemObjects Elements. This example shows how distinct type aliases can be used in combination with extension methods and operators to create semantic types.

In Oxygene two kinds of type aliases are supported. Regular ones, which are really just another name for the same type and distinct ones, which are treated as unique types but using the aliased type as storage. Extension methods can be used on the last one to add features to these types.
